                <p>Kyle Cook runs a YouTube channel called WebDevSimplified. If you've ever dream or plan to become a web developer, whatever the niche may be, then I'd really reccomend you check out his content. He teaches all stuff related to Web Development. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, extensions, etc, you name it. He pretty much has all you need to kickstart your journey as a web developer. He even has tips and many other project tutorials which you can follow. I personally have been helped a lot by all of his content, especially the projects. I'll learn stuff about something then I'll use the project tutorials that he made. That way I could use all my knowledge that I learned, and if I ever got stuck, he'll tell me the solution in the tutorial and I learn something again.</p>
